Fix bug in which alternate divisors were not used

This commit updates the fizzbuzz_for_num method to start using 
the fizz_divisor and buzz_divisor parameters that were added
to the method signature in 85ca623.

Verified the fix by running existing tests in test_fizzbuzz.py
which were previously failing and now pass.
